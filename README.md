# iMessage Spammer

Spam a contact from any MacOS device using the Messages app.

Note: this is a NodeJS app and will not run in the browser (it requires `child_process` to run).

### How it works
Spammer will take a string of text, break it into individual messages (one message per break line (`\n`) in the string).

Spammer takes care to maximise annoyance to the contact you wish to prank by ensuring the messages are sent consecutively and that each message is delivered. As such, a long piece of text, such as the script for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, resulted in just under 5000 messages sent over approximately 15 minutes.

### Installation
```bash
yarn add imessage-spammer
```

### Usage
1. Open `Messages`
2. Ensure the contact is in the list of previous messages on the left (if not, send a new message to the contact you wish to spam)
3. Create a new JS file
4. Find a long piece of text, preferably a movie script as it contains lots of text on different lines
5. Call `spammer` with the first argument being the contact you wish to spam and the second being the text to spam them with
6. Run your script from the command line

### Example
The below message would send five messages:

`spam.js`:
```js
import spammer from 'imessage-spammer'; // or: const spammer = require('imessage-spammer');

const message = `
This would be one message.
This would the message 2.
A third message.
And a fourth
`;

spammer('James Johnson', message);
```

Then run from the command line:
```bash
node ./spam.js
```
